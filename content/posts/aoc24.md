# :christmas_tree: Advent Of Code 2024

I have, for three consecutive years now, attempted to solve the annual http://adventofcode.com puzzles, but never followed through with them. This year I hope to finally fix that by forcing myself to blog about them every day!

> While working, my solutions are probably not always the best/most idiomatic/most efficcient/blablabla, you probably shouldnâ€™t use them

## :wrench: The Tools
My language of choice this year was ðŸ’œ Kotlin as Itâ€™s the language Iâ€™m most comfortable with, but I also attempt to solve every day in at least another language.
It was also an excellent excuse to try out the [Kotlin Notebooks](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-notebook-overview.html), Jupyter using Kotlin, that JetBrains created.
