# ❌ Day 03 - Mull it over

We have a long String like this: 
```plain text
xmul(2,4)%&mul[3,7]!@^do_not_mul(5,5)+mul(32,64]then(mul(11,8)mul(8,5))
```

Which is a dump from the memory of a corrupted computer, but it still contains some valid instructions. We have to filter out the intact instructions and execute them.

# Part One

For part one, we only need to check for one instruction: `mul(x, y)`, which, as you probably guessed, is a multiplication instruction. To get the result for the part, we have to find all mul instructions, execute them, and sum the result.

To parse out the `mul`s, I whooped out the good old [regexr](https://regexr.com) and came up with this bad boy:

```regex
mul\([0-9]+,[0-9]+\)
```

And made this little piece of beatiful kotlin code to execute the found instructions:

```kotlin
fun parseMultiplication(str: String): Int = 
  str.trim { !it.isDigit() && it != ',' }
    .split(",")
    .map { it.toInt() }
    .fold(1) { acc, num -> acc * num}
```

Then I combined both and finished part one:

```kotlin
input.let {
  Regex("""mul\([0-9]+,[0-9]+\)""").findAll(it)
}.sumOf {
  parseMultiplication(it.value)
}
```

And for the given test input it returned `161`, which is correct, so let's carry on!

## Part Two

Now for Part two we have two new instructions, `do()` and `don't()`, which enable and disable the multiplication instructions. Basically, if we find a `mul` and the last other instruction was `don't()`, do not count the value. The code starts with `mul`s enabled. 

For this task, we got a new Puzzle input, so lets take a look at it:

```txt
xmul(2,4)&mul[3,7]!^don't()_mul(5,5)+mul(32,64](mul(11,8)undo()?mul(8,5))
```

The first `mul` are executed, but the second and fourth are not because of the `don't()` before them. After the fourth, we find a `do()` inside of the `undo()` so we count the last one too (The other ones are invalidly structured so we can ignore them).

This required a bit of modification to my Regex to also parse the new instructions, and a pattern match to check which instruction should be executed: 

```kotlin
var enabled = true
input.let {
  Regex("""(mul\([0-9]+,[0-9]+\)|do[n't]*\(\))""").findAll(it)
}.sumOf {
  when {
    it.value.startsWith("mul") -> if (enabled) parseMultiplication(it.value) else 0
    it.value == "don't()" -> { enabled = false; 0}
    it.value == "do()" -> { enabled = true; 0 }
    else -> 0
  }
}
```

Which returns `48` on the test input and secures the second star for today!
