# :wave: I'm Max!
I'm a german full-stack developer with a focus on backend and game-related systems, but I also do a lot of programming for fun and like to experiment!

:alien: I also engage in local hacker culture (https://binhacken.de and https://cccwi.de for example)

## :computer: Tech

I primarily program with Kotlin, C(++) and (Java|Type)Script, and either use frameworks for my tasks (Quarkus, Svelte), or try to create my own (https://github.com/maxbossing/Minekraft for example, a modular Library for Minecraft plugin development using Kotlin).

I host most of my work and tools myself, using Docker, Kubernetes, and many other open source tools.

## :thought_balloon: Philosophy

I am a proponent of Open-Source-Software, and believe in freedom of information.

I also adhere to the https://www.ccc.de/en/hackerethics

## :money_with_wings: Hire me
To hire me as a developer, please contact me personally (see [Contact Me](#-contact-me)).

**Before you contact me,** please make sure that you have an already finished concept ready or that you are willing to pay extra to work out the concept.  ****

### Pricing is set on a per-project basis

I can and will not set a standard pricing table, as it is very project-specific. If you want to know how much a project would cost, you can contact me and I will give you my best estimate, *no strings and guarantees attached*.
